# Pi-Day-Project-2020

This was my submission for my school's Pi Day Competition in 2020. It is a game similar to Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game, but instead of a dinosaur there is a pi symbol. The game was made in Java using Java's Swing library. 

This program won be a giftcard to a local Greek restraunt.
